                        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                        <p> My name is Niels Winkels, im a 18 year old student in the Netherlands studying software development at Roc
                            Mondriaan.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I grew up in a small town and went to primary school (elementry school) there, after that I went to secondary
                            school (high school) in Delft were I graduated on Mavo level. after that I tried Havo, but that wasnt't
                            really my thing. So now im here studying at Roc Mondriaan also in Delft.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I hope to graduate and start a career in front-end/web development, since my interest peaks
                            here.

                        <h1>My hobbies</h1>
                        <p> I have many hobby's, one of them is listening to music, I had 128.664 minutes listened on
                            spotify so I guess you could say im a music fanatic, if you want to discuss anything about
                            music you are always welcome to contact me :)
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Another hobby I got into recently is editing video's, I like to record gameplay and edit
                            them for my own purpose, im not that good at editing yet but I really like to learn new
                            technique's and improve.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I also really like to play football, im not that good at it, but its nice to just play a
                            sport with my best friends and have a good time, but I also go the gym to stay fit and
                            healthy.

                        <h1>Coding</h1>
                        <p> For school I already had to do alot of coding, in the my work page I will go into further
                            detail but here are some things I already made.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For project I had to make a higher lower game with dices in the first semester, for the
                            second semester we had to work in groups of 3 to make either whack-a-mole, tic-tac-toe or
                            battle-ship, I had to make battle ship, it was a bit tough at first but im happy how it
                            turned out. For our third semester we had to make a web-catalog where we needed to fetch
                            node.js data from the server to our html page. Currently we are working on a dashboard page
                            with chart.js data and using mongodb to store username and password data.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For HTML & CSS we already learned all the basics, things as grid, flex and media query's.
                            For javascript we already learned about Arrays, Functions and Objects.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Currently for HTML we are learning bootstrap, it looks complicated at first but it makes sense to use it since it saves a lot of time. 
                            The site you are currently looking at is <span class="fw-bold">ENTIRELY Made in bootstrap!</span>
